## 🧠 Step 2: Choose an AI Model

Ollama supports a growing number of models. Some examples:

| Model                | Description                                 | Command                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `deepseek-coder:7b` | Smaller size, faster performance            | `ollama run deepseek-coder:7b`    |
| `deepseek-coder:14b`| Larger, better reasoning but more resources | `ollama run deepseek-coder:14b`   |
| `llama3`            | Latest Meta model (April 2024)              | `ollama run llama3`               |
| `mistral`           | Lightweight and optimized                   | `ollama run mistral`              |

To view all available models:
```bash
ollama list
```

---

## 📦 Step 3: Download & Run a Model Locally

Use the `ollama run` command to automatically download and start the model:

```bash
ollama run deepseek-coder:7b
```

🔄 It will download the model on first run and start a local interactive session.

---

## 🛠 Step 4: Using the Model in Your Terminal

Once it’s running, just type your question or prompt directly in the terminal:

```txt
> What is the difference between Python and JavaScript?
```

Press **Enter**, and the model will respond right there.

---

## ⚙️ Advanced: Run a Specific Model Version or Pull it First

### Pull a model without starting it:
```bash
ollama pull deepseek-coder:14b
```

### Then run it later:
```bash
ollama run deepseek-coder:14b
```

---

## 🔄 Switch Between Models

Simply run another model:
```bash
ollama run llama3
```

You don’t need to uninstall anything — you can keep multiple models.

---

## 💡 Tips

- `7b` models use less RAM and are faster. Ideal for most laptops.
- `14b` models give better responses but may need >16GB RAM or dedicated GPU.
- For coding tasks, `deepseek-coder` is optimized for code generation and explanation.

---

## 🧽 Optional: Clean Up

To remove downloaded models:
```bash
ollama rm deepseek-coder:7b
```
